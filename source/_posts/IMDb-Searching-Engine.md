Based on [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), I finished a Java project *IMDb Searching Engine*, which can be downloaded from my [GitHub](https://github.com/GaoFangshu/IMDb-Searching-Engine).

However, this project has a lot of room for improvement:
* **Performance optimisation:** use parallel stream operations instead of for-loop?
* **Coupling problem:** low coupling, better-structured design. In this field, I am still a begginer :)
* **Java OOP:** The setting of classes can be improved. It's time to read [Core Java](https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304) seriously, which I always delay :(

Of course, I referred many documents from Stack Overflow:
* JScrollPane & ScrollBar:

* ActionListener:
